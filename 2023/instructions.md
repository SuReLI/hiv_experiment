Hi Vera, Adil, and Paul,
Next Tuesday afternoon, 10 of my students will present their work on a "flash" project. They have 12 hours to discover the simulator of an HIV infected patient and implement an algorithm that searches for a therapeutic strategy (2 different types of medication, on or off every 5 days over 1000 days) to boost the immune response and propose key perspectives and work directions.
So the job is both technical (the algorithm) but also I expect some good perspectives (currently, the simulator always simulates the same patient, and is deterministic, so it would be a lot more convincing to improve on that for instance) and ideas to implement them.
This is a group assignment and I don't really care about the final grade. What I want is for the students to have a better technical, theoretical and practical understanding of RL problems by the end of the class. But I also need to give a grade to the students, so I'm trying to make this as useful as possible.
The presentation is planned between 3pm and 4:15pm on Tuesday. Would you be available to play a jury role?

A few more details:
- The presentation will be in French.
- We agreed the students would play the role of a team making a technical proposal, to apply for a grant.
- The evaluation criteria for this grant are (in French, and they express my pedagogical objectives):
  clarté de présentation de l'algo que vous mettez en oeuvre,
  efficacité du contrôleur appris,
  pertinence des solutions techniques envisagées pour l'algo,
  pertinence des hypothèses de l'étude (déterminisme, variabilité des patients, reward model) et des solutions possibles.

Cheers,
Emmanuel
